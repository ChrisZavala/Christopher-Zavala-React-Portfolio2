          I am passionate about building excellent software full stack applications that improves
          the lives of those around me. I am thoughtful and extremely diligent about the projects that I create.

        <p className="text-xl">
          My goal from this journey is to refine my craft and skill in this coding bootcamp to become a full-stack web developer
          with the skills necessary to enjoy my new career but also bring the skills that I have learn through all my life experiences
          and bring them altogether in one big broad stroke. I have a degree a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Electrical Engineering and I also
          have a love for the engineering process and solve problems. With this brief introduction that I have told you, I hope to have given
          you a little understanding about what I like to do and love to create. I hope you enjoy this site as much as I have enjoyed the
          process of bringing it to life! Thank you.
